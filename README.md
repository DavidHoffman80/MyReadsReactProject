# MyReads Udacity Nano Degree project
This project is part of my Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. This project concentrates on creating a React application that tracks and searches for books for a user. The user can put a book on one of three shelves: "Currently reading", "Want to read" or "Read".

## Project Goal
Creat a React app that tracks books for the user. The applications main page consists of 3 book "shelves": Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. The user should be able to move a book from one shelf to another as they find new books and complete reading a book. The application also consists of a search page where the user can search for new books. The user will also be able to move a book from the search page to a book shelf.
